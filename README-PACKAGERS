		  AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERING ENGINES

As of version 0.1.13, Quarry supports site configuration file, which
can be used to provide default configuration.  Most importantly,
engines (like GNU Go) can be listed in site configuration to save a
few movements for users.

Site configuration is completely unintrusive for users, since they can
still change all parameters and hide (but not remove) unwanted
engines.

So, this is how you could enhance Quarry package.  If, when installing
the package, you detect that, say GNU Go, is installed too, create a
file `/usr/share/quarry/quarryrc' (normally, the name might differ if
you use a different $(datadir)) with the following contents:

---8<--- cut here ---8<---
[GTP Engine "GNU Go"]
Screen name format	= "%n %v"
Name			= "GNU Go"
Version			= "<version>"
Command line		= "<path to GNU Go binary> --mode gtp --quiet"
Supported games		= "Go"
---8<--- cut here ---8<---

Note that the name in ``[GTP Engine "<name>"]'' should not include any
version numbers.

<version> should be the version GNU Go reports itself, not the version
of GNU Go package.  If it is too much trouble, you can just omit the
version, Quarry will supply it as soon as the user starts his first
game against GNU Go.

<path to GNU Go> would typically be `/usr/bin/gnugo',
`/usr/games/gnugo' or `/usr/games/bin/gnugo'.

Obviously, the very same functionaity could work the way round, when
installing GNU Go and detecting an installed Quarry.
