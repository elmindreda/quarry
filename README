			     ABOUT QUARRY

Quarry is a universal board game interface program.  At present it
supports three games: Go, Amazons and Reversi.  It is intended to be
useful for both users and developers of game engines (i.e. programs
that play board games).

At present, Quarry is slowly approaching first stable release.  It's
uses are currently limited to playing against a computer program
(e.g. GNU Go) and browsing and editing SGF game records.

Latest Quarry versions can be found at the homepage:

			     INSTALLATION

The usual `./configure; make; make install' should build and install
Quarry.  The only serious requirement for Quarry are GTK+ 2.x and
librsvg 2.5+ libraries, everything else must be present on a sane
system.  See file INSTALL for details.


			    RUNNING QUARRY

Please refer to the Quarry Manual for help.  If, for some reason, you
cannot open the manual from Quarry Help menu, direct your browser to
the file `help/C/quarry.html'.  (There may also be translations of the
manual to your language in directories other than `C'.)


			    REPORTING BUGS

Point your browser to

		  https://gna.org/bugs/?group=quarry

Before submitting a bug, please update to latest CVS version of Quarry
and verify that the bug is still present.  Don't forget to check if
the bug has been submitted already.

Please include the following information in your bug report:

* Bug description and the way to reproduce the bug.

* Output of Quarry in the terminal, if any.  It would typically die
  with a message like this:

	quarry: file-name.c:123: some_function_name: Assertion `...'
	failed.

* If you fail to configure or build Quarry in the first place, please
  send in several last lines of `configure's and/or `make's output,
  depending on where the problem occurred.

* System information, including version of GTK+.  You can find it by
  typing

	pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0

  in command line.  Remember that only GTK+ 2.0 or later is supported.
  If you have an older version, Quarry will fail to configure and it
  is not a bug.

* Everything else you find relevant.

    On the site there is a disclaimer with the following text:

	"Disclaimer: Background textures found on this site were not
	created by the webmaster. They were obtained from various
	sources on the internet that labeled them as "freely
	distributable". If you should discover images in this
	collection which you recognize as copyrighted, please email
	the webmaster immediately so that they may be removed."

    And in its "Terms of use" section, it is stated that

	"The background textures found on this site were not created
	by the webmaster, but were obtained from various sources on
	the internet that described these graphics as freeware. Some
	of the authors, however, might disapprove if their graphics
	were used, for example, as part of a commercial software
	package. Therefore, these graphics are best suited for
	personal use (i.e. on a personal web site.)"

    I'm very interested in a good texture that is either cleanly
    licensed in a non-restrictive way that allows redistribution and
    modification or is in public domain.  If you happen to have/know
    about such a texture that would fit Quarry's look, please send it
    or a link to it to <quarry-dev@gna.org>.
