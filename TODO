		      THINGS PLANNED FOR 0.4/1.0

* INTERNET GAME SERVER(S) SUPPORT

** Start with IGS.
   KGS has proprietary protocol and NNGS/old IGS isn't really used
   anymore.

* PLAYING GAMES

** Optionally display move list.
   Requires pondering on where to place it, since the right column has
   no more place...

* VIEWING GAME RECORDS

** Display values of various SGF properties (`VA',  `BM' etc.)

** Support multiple games in one file, same for editing.

** GAME TREE VIEW

*** Maybe add command to narrow to a subtree.

* EDITING GAME RECORDS

** Support editing various SGF properties (`VA', `BM' etc.)

* BOARD APPEARANCE

** Make Amazons look like chess queens (with SVG.)

* GTP SUPPORT

** Add some sort of GTP console for generic GTP engine access.
   Look at GoGui for an example.

** Add `GTP wrapper' mode.
   The idea is to sit on a GTP channel, display the board status and
   keep SGF records of what's going on.  This way you can connect an
   engine to an arbitrary internet GTP server and see the games in
   Quarry in real-time.

* SGF PARSING

** Complete support for charsets.

* INTERNAL BOARD CODE

** Score sekis correctly.

* GENERAL GUI

** Make the Control Center nicer, with graphics.
   Requires artistic contributions, therefore postponed from 0.2.

* GENERAL

** Drop support for GTK+ 2.0 and 2.2 at least.
   Remove all related code, obviously.

** Make functions receive `size_t' and `gsize' where appropriate.
   E.g. string lengths should have these types.  Be extra careful with
   passing through `...'.

** Maybe reimplement everything in C++/Gtkmm?  (Loads of work...)



			HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE

When adding a specific to-do item, start it with a verb (``fix'',
``implement'', ``add'' etc.)  When adding a placement (for instance, a
name of a module) for to-do items, make it a noun or a phrase that
acts as a noun and uppercase the entire line to make it stand out.

When something has been implemented, delete or update the appropriate
entry here, don't mark it with ``done'' or something similar.  This
file is only meant to track unimplemented, but planned features.
Those that have been implemented should be mentioned in NEWS (and in
ChangeLog.)
