--- New in Quarry 0.1.9 ----------------------------------------------

* Compilation-time error with GTK+ 2.4 fixed (bug #898,
  mateusz@kaduk.net.)

* Minor bug-fixes in game information editing.

--- New in Quarry 0.1.8 ----------------------------------------------

* Full support for SGF game information, including editing.

* Support for resignation.  Most importantly, Quarry now handles
  resignations by GTP engines.

* Support for SGF labels in addition to recently added support for SGF
  markup.  Displaying code still need tweaks to make labels more
  readable in certain cases.

* Quarry is now bundled with documentation.

* You can now choose in Preferences dialog whether to save all SGF
  files in UTF-8 or preserve original encoding.  However, support for
  other encodings is at about the same level as in 0.1.7.

* Bug-fixes, better support for earlier GTK+ versions and yet further
  improved support for locales.


--- New in Quarry 0.1.7 ----------------------------------------------

* Partial support for different encodings of SGF files.  It is not yet
  complete, but at least all single-byte encodings should work.

* GTP engines now automatically score games they play.  (by Martin
  Holters)

* Comments can now be edited.  Just modify the text in the comment
  pane and your changes will be remembered.

* Mouse wheel can be used to go back and forth between moves
  (suggested by David Gómez).

* Othello disks now look like disks, not like Go stones.

* Markup appearance is now configurable.

* Quarry is internationalized, though there are no translations yet.

* Other small improvements and bug-fixes.


--- New in Quarry 0.1.6 ----------------------------------------------

* False eyes are now carefully examined and don't yield territory when
  they shouldn't when scoring Go games.  However, sekis are still not
  handled.

* SGF markup is finally displayed on board.  Note that if you have
  customized board background, markup can appear just barely
  noticeable to you.  Markup appearance will be customizeable in the
  next version.

* Many miscellaneous improvements in Preferences dialog.  It shouldn't
  crash anymore.

* Board (goban) now visually indicates when it has focus and so when
  arrow keys without Alt can be used for navigation.

* Bug-fixes (including bug #522) and minor improvements.

--- New in Quarry 0.1.5 ----------------------------------------------

* Time control.  This includes time limit per game, time limit per
  move and Canadian overtime (also known as Canadian byo-yomi).  Of
  course games without time limits are possible as well.  Note that at
  present if a player runs out of time, he doesn't lose automatically.

* Important game information is now displayed under player names.  For
  Go this is the number of captures and the komi.  For Othello this is
  the number of disks a player has on board.

* It is now safe to navigate game tree while a game is played.  For
  instance, when you have two GTP engines playing against each other,
  you can go back to the game beginning and study moves at whatever
  speed you like.  In earlier versions this would lead to a corrupted
  game.

* Bug-fixes, including better support for locales.

--- New in Quarry 0.1.4 ----------------------------------------------

* Severe bug in 0.1.3 fixed.

--- New in Quarry 0.1.3 ----------------------------------------------

* Support for game rules.  This includes board size for all three
  games and hadicap (both fixed and free) and komi for Go.

* Go games can now be scored by the user.  Automatic scoring by the
  playing GTP engines is not yet implemented.

* Customizable board appearance (only backround at present, not the
  pieces).  Because of the appearance of certain internal machinery,
  all three games now look differently by default: Go looks just like
  before, Amazons has checkerboard pattern and Othello has dark green
  solid background.

* Bug-fixes, including some backports to pre-2.4 GTK+.

--- New in Quarry 0.1.2 ----------------------------------------------

* Support for saving SGF files integrated into GUI.

* Finally a way to pass when playing Go.

* New feature: SGF diff.  It will allow to generate difference between
  two SGF files as a third SGF file.  This way you will be able to
  easily find what has changed between two version of an SGF file as
  easily as you can find difference between versions of a text file
  with UNIX `diff' program.

  At present the feature is far from being really useful.  It is added
  as a proof of concept.  Look for program `sgf-diff' in `src/sgf/' if
  you want to give it a try.

* Many bug-fixes.
